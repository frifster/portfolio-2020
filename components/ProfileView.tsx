          I am a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> specializing in React JS and React Native. I have five (5) years of professional experience developing websites and mobile applications. I have helped local and international clients design systems that will optimize their business operation processes. Applications that automate tasks and generate reports are my forte.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leading a team of developers also has honed me to actively work with people, and business partners in identifying the pain points of a project, while also implementing solutions that would work best for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to broaden my knowledge in web development by learning new tools that could help small to medium-scale businesses to streamline their operations. Recently, I was able to share my expertise when my family and I started local businesses. The experience gave me a business ownerâ€™s point of view and has helped in my thought process for developing systems.
        </p>
